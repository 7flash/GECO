# Gnosis-Ecosystem-Fund
**_Creating an environment where ambitious teams can expand and shape the blockchain ecosystem towards a redistributed future._**

The Gnosis Ecosystem Fund empowers teams to drive the global adoption of decentralized applications by leveraging the full potential of Gnosis' products and protocols. Our mission is to create a collaborative environment where ambitious projects can expand and shape the Ethereum ecosystem. 

We provide select applicants with funding, mentoring, and marketing resources to help them activate and engage with the community around their project. Our team also offers resources to onboard students and developers new to decentralized technologies. To us, developing the community means investing in diverse talent with a variety of interests and backgrounds. Are you enthusiastic about building modules and integrations for our products, enhancing user experience, or passionate about new market mechanisms and governance? Well, this is your opportunity to #BUIDL!

We welcome you to explore a diverse range of topics such as tooling, infrastructure, and research, that fall in line with the products we're building at Gnosis. Our accomplished team of developers, product managers, and communication specialists will provide ongoing support and guidance. 

To reach our goal of a decentralized future, it is imperative that we support developers who want to build on distributed platforms.We believe that the Gnosis Ecosystem Fund will bring us one step closer to the redistributed future we’re imagining!  
 


### What kind of projects are we looking for? 

The main focus of the grant is to support projects that further the Gnosis ecosystem and our core mission to redistribute the future. Your proposed project should be directly connected to our products and vision. 
Proposals should focus on:

- Creating tools/modules/extension for our products
  
Our platforms and potential buidl ideas include:

- DutchX: buyer interface, token BuyBacks, deposit or withdraw widget. 
- Gnosis Safe: recovery modules, transfer limits or Gnosis Safe integration into Dapps
- PM: prediction market use cases, oracle integrations, wallet integrations or a futarchy interface

Furthermore, we will also consider projects involved in research and education related to:
- Decentralized exchanges
- Prediction markets/ Futarchy
- Market mechanism
- Governance
- Dapp useability 
- Dapp scalability 

### What are we offering? 

**Funding**

We want to support a wide range of projects in both topic and scale. For this reason, we are offering grants of between $5.000 and $100.000, which will be paid out in GNO tokens. If approved, you will be allocated a sum that reflects the scope and ambition of your proposal. To get a sense of how much funding to request for your proposal, check out our bounties and current projects for an estimation. 

**Mentoring**

If you become part of the Gnosis ecosystem, you will be offered more than just financial support. You will also be assigned and receive support from a Gnosis developer who will act as your project mentor. Furthermore, we can connect you to experts in the field and to experienced legal, admin, and financial advisors as needed. As our ecosystem continues to develop, we hope to foster a supportive community where past projects are willing to support and mentor new projects. 

**Community/ Outreach**

Funded projects will also have the option of working at and organizing meetups in our co-working space Full Node in Berlin. Bigger projects also will have the possibility to speak at DappCon.
