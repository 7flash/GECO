# Tenzorum Project | Gnosis Ecosystem Fund
_This is a guideline on how to best structure your proposal._

## Project Overview

### Project name
> Tenzorum Project
### Team members 

Radek Ostrowski - CTO
Mark Pereira - Fullstack developer
Peter - Product manager

### What project are you building 

A meta-transaction relay server that accepts tokens as payments for conducting the meta-transactions. The relay server will be able to convert the payment tokens to ETH or any other chosen choice of reward using DutchX as a liquidity provider.

### Why did you decide to build it 

We decided to build it to enable users who are using dapps to conduct transactions using tokens when they do not have ETH. When new users are onboarded to web3 products, many of them do not have cryptocurrency but have the ability to earn tokens. They cannot use or transfer these tokens without ETH. The usual route in acquiring ETH is through KYC and exchanges which provide a high level of friction for the first time web3 users.

### How long will it take 

8 Months

### How much funding are you requesting  

$120,000

### How did you hear about the GEF

## Your Proposal 
### Project description

We are building a service node network which allows dapps to conduct meta transactions in a p2p resilient manner. Meta-transactions are user signed transactions which are sent to a server which then takes the transaction to then execute through a smart contract. This allows dapps to completely abstract gas away from the user and cover the cost of gas for users. For wallets such as gnosis safe, meta-transactions allow users to spend funds they have in a separate wallet without needing to export keys or move funds. Part of the roadmap is the design and release of a single server implementation 

### Features

- EIP 1077 implementation - Universal Logins + Relayer Network

- Gnosis Safe integration into Tenzorum SDK + Universal Logins SDK

### Team description

**Radek Ostrowski**: CTO with 15 years of big data and systems infrastructure experience. Transitioned into blockchain engineering 2 years ago.

**Mark Pereira**: Fullstack developer with experience building dapps and web3 architecture. Before the web3 space, he was an web developer at a variety of agencies.

**Peter (Pet3rpan)**: Product manager with a user experience design background. Led product design for venture funded startups before transitioning into the web3 space.

### Timeline, Milestones and Deliverables

#### Phase I

**Description:** Dapps will be able to set up their own meta-transaction relay node themselves and start collecting meta-transactions. The relay server will take in tokens for rewards using DutchX, preferences and profitability margins will be controlled by the server.
Phase: Single relayer server designed with economical controls + DutchX Integration
**Time:** 4 Months
**Price:** $60,000

*Payout structure:
Begin phase with $30,000 and as the phase is finished, we recieve theremaining $30,000*

#### Phase II

**Description:** Gnosis Safe will be implemented into the Tenzorum SDK + Universal Logins SDK, users will now deploy a gnosis safe main net wallet where ERC1077 will be used to execute the meta-transaction. 
Phase: Gnosis safe implemented into Tenzorum and Universal Logins SDK
**Time:** 4 Months
**Price:** $60,000

*Payout structure:
Begin phase with $30,000 and as the phase is finished, we recieve theremaining $30,000*
