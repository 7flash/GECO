### What project are you building

Tribes platform for communities similar to Reddit and Patreon, that incorporates elements from blockchain cryptocurrency such as DAO’s and governance to enable engaged communities.

### Why did you decide to build it

Tribes comes from the need to open up better collaboration and monetization tools for people who create content.

### How long will it take

4 months

### How much funding are you requesting

42k EUR

### How did you hear about the GECO

I first heard about it from Mareen Gläske’s Medium post, Unveiling the Gnosis Ecosystem Fund.

## Your Proposal

### Project describtion

Tribes is a platform of tribes which is a collection of people centered around a topic. Each tribe on our platform is a Gnosis Safe DAO with added smart contracts for extra functionality, from marketplaces to governance. We’ve made it easy to for users to visit Tribes and begin using the Safe without having prior experience interacting with the blockchain. We allow creators to build their own Tribe that is structured for the needs of their community. Each tribe has paid monthly subscription tiers for community members who want greater involvement. Subscriptions come in the form of ERC721 tokens from that tribe. Every month subscription funds are sent to the creators of the tribe and members who posted content that was valued by that tribe. Tribes incentivizes an ecosystem of reputation and quality driven content creation.

An example of a tribe might be a community around a DutchX with custom modules allowing them to monitor and affect their DAO all from the tribes platform.

The goal of this project is to increase dapp usability and scalability by allowing tribes to create their own open source modules that hook into the Safe and used outside of Tribes. Another feature is to extending the safe execution function to allow for DAO type elements such as weighted votes.

This will not only help us but other projects that need similar functionality for their Safe. Also, tribes is taking a hybrid approach to how decentralized it is. As we move forward, more parts of the platform will be decentralized as the ecosystem develops. Designing tribes with modularity in mind to reach decentralization is an important goal.

This project will help onboard the next wave of users into the crypto space by significantly lowering UX barriers and providing real value for communities with governance, monetization tools, NFT engagement, lower fees, and censorship-resistance. The modules we create for tribes will benefit dapps scale and bring in usability for new and experienced users.

### Features

**Governance module** - Simple governance add/remove users and features from the tribe or safe. More complex features will be added later.

**Custody Solution** - A solution that allows us to onboard users with zero knowledge of crypto and make transactions on their behalf, mainly the handle signing of transactions without storing private keys.

**Tribe contract** - Rewrite token contract to be more modular and customizable for each tribe. Create an interface for erc721 tokens with Gnosis Safe.

**UX/UI** - Redesign the flow from on-boarding to trading tokens. I’ve personally designed most of the site and would prefer if a designer came in and created mockups that we can implement. We also need to create animations for actions and transitions on the frontend.

**Subscriptions** - Two potential options to handle this, one is with meta transactions using EIP1337, and the other is to do a manual transactions on a shared Safe with the user.

**Security Audit** - Once the token contract is ready we can start the contract audit phase. We expect this to take longer time because of the back and forth between between developers and auditors.
