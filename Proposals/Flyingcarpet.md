### What project are you building 
At Flyingcarpet, we are building the decentralised geospatial layer for Earth observation. The Flyingcarpet Network incentivises data scientists to build a decentralised library of geospatial analytics-extraction models. Analytics are made continually available to paying organisations via our Analytics API, which will also function as an oracle that can be integrated directly into smart contracts. Models are tokenised so that anyone can invest in them and share in their future revenue.
### Why did you decide to build it 
Julien picked this idea because he had previously worked on building AI-powered IoT swarms. The increasing number of Earth observation satellites, combined with recent advances in both machine learning and blockchain led to a greater vision: using blockchain-based incentives to build a decentralised library of machine learning Earth observation models.

Earth observation satellite imagery has such broad applications across all organisations and industries that it will be a key driver of economic growth in the next decade and beyond. However, since such analytics are currently provided by centralised and pricey firms, only organisations with considerable financial resources can access geospatial analytics. As a result, many organisations that would benefit the most from these analytics, such as SMEs, non-profits, NGOs and humanitarian efforts, are priced out.

In a world where economic inequality is increasing and power is becoming increasingly centralised, we at Flyingcarpet are determined to ensure that Earth observation is open to everyone. We envisage that Flyingcarpet will massively increase organisational access to Earth observation analytics while also distributing value to data scientists in a fairer way.
### How long will it take 
We aim to be live and fully operational on the Ethereum testnet in Q3 2019 and mainnet in Q4. The first Flyingcarpet models will be used by paying customers in Q1 2019. 
### How much funding are you requesting  
$100,000.

## Your Proposal 
### Project description
We decided to build a decentralised library of Earth observation (EO) machine learning models for several reasons. Firstly, analytics derived from EO satellite imagery can potentially benefit organisations of all types and sizes. Secondly, these analytics are currently only available to organisations with considerable financial resources. Thirdly, in order to access high-quality work, skilled data scientists must work for siloed firms that capture most of the value that they create. Fourthly, if the machine learning models and datasets generating EO analytics can be trust-minimised so that the models can function as oracles, we can radically open up smart contract use cases.

We decided to build Flyingcarpet to address these issues and to ensure a more egalitarian value distribution in the emerging EO space. We want to: (i) improve access to EO analytics (ii) bring down the cost of high-quality analytics by building a massively scalable, decentralised library of geospatial analytics models (iii) ensure that data scientists are able to capture the full value of their work and (iv) build an API that programmatically inserts analytics generated by models into smart contracts in near real-time. 

We believe that Gnosis would benefit from funding Flyingcarpet for several reasons. Firstly, we fully share Gnosis’ mission to distribute resources in new, more efficient ways by creating new assets and incentives across a network. Secondly, Flyingcarpet EO insights can be directly integrated into the Gnosis Predictions Dashboard to provide increased information to market participants. Finally, Flyingcarpet analytics can also be used to evaluate the outcome of geospatial market events.

Ultimately, we believe that Flyingcarpet models can provide Gnosis with the necessary infrastructure to enable trust-minimised physical world predictions. Flyingcarpet could enable prediction markets to form around any sort of physical world data, such as commodity price changes, glacial melt due to global warming or the rate of Amazonian deforestation. These analytics could be integrated directly into the Gnosis Predictions Dashboard.

**Flyingcarpet Workflow:**
1. **Model Creation Organization:** Flyingcarpet community stakeholders collectively organize a token-curated registry (TCR) of future model competitions based on requests from organisations seeking EO analytics. 
2. **Annotation Portal:** Our satellite providers provide the relevant datasets, which are pushed to the Flyingcarpet Annotation Portal, where human classifiers annotate training datasets for model competitions. This is a Mechanical Turk-like interface that will provide economic opportunities for low-earners around the world. We are partnering with Gems.org (a leading decentralised Mechanical Turk platform) to build out this interface.
3. **Model Creation Competition:** Data scientists compete in model creation competitions, not dissimilar to the ones run by Numerai, to produce optimal models for the paying organisation’s request.
4. **Models Dashboard:** Successful models are stored decentrally with all computation taking place off-chain. Analytics from these models are made continually available to paying organisations via the Models Dashboard and are accessible via the Analytics API.
5. **Model Investments:** Successful models are converted into investible entities that can function as financial instruments, enabling them to be used in prediction markets, such as Gnosis, as diversified investment vehicles, and more (please see our white paper for more information). The Flyingcarpet team will bootstrap development as far as possible by investing in these early models in order to generate income for the team.
### Features
The Flyingcarpet Network will be, at least initially, built on top of Ethereum. In the future, Flyingcarpet models will be interoperable with other blockchain ecosystems.

The three main elements of the Flyingcarpet Network architecture are examined in the below high-level technical information.

**Option Planning (Choosing Model Competitions)**

A token-curated registry (TCR) is used by the Flyingcarpet community to organize what model competitions are run. Future model competition options are added to the TCR and selected by community members by staking Nitrogen (NTN) token. When a new model competition is going to start, the top TCR listing is removed from the registry and the competition is run for that specific model need.

The Flyingcarpet model competition planning TCR is currently implemented as an Ethereum smart-contract (live on the Rinkeby testnet) and will have an accompanying React.js front-end where community members (token holders) will be able to view the TCR listings, add new listings and stake existing entries.

**Model Creation**
In this phase, a competition is run where data scientists compete to create the most effective machine learning models for specific use cases. Before a competition can be run, raw satellite data must first be sourced from our Flyingcarpet imagery partners. This imagery is fetched via direct API integrations with these partners and is stored decentrally (e.g. IPFS) with corresponding hashes stored inside Flyingcarpet’s Ethereum smart contracts.

Next, our network of human classifiers annotate the raw satellite imagery to create both the training and testing datasets. Annotation occurs via our Flyingcarpet Annotation Portal, a Mechanical Turk-style React.js-based web3-enabled portal whereby human classifiers earn token (in-browser) for their work. The resulting JSON annotations are also stored decentrally with only hashes on-chain.

Finally, the competition gets underway. Data scientists train their models using the (annotated) training dataset and submit them for evaluation. Data scientists may create models using their preferred machine learning libraries (e.g. TensorFlow) and model execution will occur off-chain (e.g. via iExec, Golem, etc.). After the competition ends, all submitted models are evaluated using the annotated, encrypted testing dataset and rewards are distributed to successful data scientists (for more information on the details and economics of this process, see our whitepaper).

**Model Use**
The most successful models from each competition are continually available for execution by analytics-hungry organizations. Analytics extraction requests (for existing models) are made through our Models Dashboard and are handled by the Flyingcarpet Analytics API. Organizations purchase analytics through our dashboard using our Nitrogen (NTN) token. On the smart-contract back-end, NTN is then converted to NitrogenX (Nx) token which has a dynamically controlled supply—determined by a preset bonding curve. Models are executed off-chain (as described above) and a hash (e.g. IPFS) to the resulting analytics output is provided back to requesting organizations.

### Timeline, Milestones and Deliverables
**Phase I: First Models & Annotation Portal**

**Deliverables:**

**1) Build the first Flyingcarpet models:** We are working with Sucafina (a multinational commodity trader), Ice Alive (a glacial research team) via a partnership with National Geographic & Microsoft, Nephila and AXA (insurers), Reforestum (a platform for purchasing carbon-offsets) to construct our initial use case-specific models. By the end of Q1, these initial models will be actively generating revenue on a continual basis. We will start experimenting with bonding curve pricing mechanisms at this stage in preparation for full network launch in Q2.

**2) Annotation Portal:** We have built an early iteration of our Annotation Portal and are currently in discussions with Gems.org (a decentralised Mechanical Turk) about an integration. In Q1 2019, we will open-source the portal and publish it to mainnet, opening up income opportunities for low earners worldwide to earn by annotating training datasets for Flyingcarpet models.

**Time and Price Estimate:**

$40,000 and completed by end of Q1 2019. This money will be used to take the pressure off our development teams who are currently self-funding the project. We will also use the grant money to purchase datasets for our early models. Although this cost will eventually be passed onto paying organisations, we do not currently have the leverage in business development conversations to demand that potential clients pay for their own datasets.

**Phase II: Business & Technical Development**

**Deliverables:**

**1) Business Development:** We will build a strong business development pipeline to ensure that there is constant demand from paying organisations for analytics generated by our initial models. For example, we intend to market our Sucafina coffee plantation model to other South American agribusinesses and commodity traders. We will also focus on building deeper relationships with satellite companies to better streamline the process by which they send the Flyingcarpet Network relevant datasets.

**2) Technical Development:** We will build out the decentralised model competition mechanism, corresponding UIs and the Analytics API with the aim of a beta launch by the end of Q2. We will also airdrop tokens to our data scientist community, as pioneered by Numerai, to rapidly mobilise a distributed, global pool of data scientists. 

**3) Team Growth:** Our team is currently very developer-heavy. We will need to hire the necessary talent to grow our business/marketing capabilities and ensure that we rapidly scale demand for Flyingcarpet models.

**Time and Price Estimate:**

$40,000 and completed by end of Q2 2019. We will use this money to incentivise business development people to join our team. 

**_NB_**: While the Flyingcarpet team will invest in the early models (via the staking mechanisms described in the above “Features” section) on the network in order to generate income, the majority of model revenue will still go to the data scientists that build the models. Therefore, the team’s income during this bootstrapping phase is a fraction of total network revenue, rather than the entire network revenue.

**Phase III: Network Launch**

**Deliverables:**

**1) Network Launch:** We will move all existing Flyingcarpet models onto the newly launched network and run the first decentralised model competitions. This will open up opportunities for data scientists across the world to compete with their skills and earn continual income from the models that they generate.

**2) API Release:** We aim to release our open Analytics API in Q3 2019, which will open up limitless potential for smart contract integrations and enable physical world predictions on Gnosis.

**Time and Price Estimate:**

$10,000 and completed by end of Q3 2019. We intend to use this money largely for development/bug bounties to harness the power of the community before we focus on scaling.

**Phase IV: Scaling**

**Deliverables:**

**1) Supply-Side Scaling:** We aim to start competing with the likes of Kaggle and Numerai for data scientists’ attention. The Flyingcarpet Network offers stronger incentives for data scientists than the above platforms because they are able to capture the full value of their work and earn recurring revenue from the models that they build. Therefore, we believe that we will rapidly scale this side of the network and lead to more frequent model competitions, which will compound Flyingcarpet’s network value.

**2) Demand-Side Scaling:** By removing the overheads that persist in centralised analytics firms, we will offer organisations competitively priced analytics. As network effects kick in and our pool of data scientists grows, we believe that organisations will also recognise that the Flyingcarpet Network will offer them higher-quality analytics. 

**3) Smart Contract Development:** In Q4 2019, we want to continue exploring potential integrations with traditional businesses and decentralised projects that are looking for trustworthy off-chain physical world data sources. We particularly envisage Flyingcarpet enabling products such as parametric insurance policies and catastrophe-risk policies that payout automatically when a Flyingcarpet model reports, for instance, that a flood has struck.

**Time and Price Estimate:**
$10,000 and completed by end of Q4 2019. We envisage using this money for more development bounties.
