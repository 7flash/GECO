# Bidder UI for the DutchX open protocol

## Project Overview
The DutchX open protocol currently has the following tools and application to interact with it:
- Seller Interface (React Webapp)
- Command Line Interface
- Public REST API
- Bots (Liquidity Bot)
- Tasks scheduler (example usage: reporting and auto-claiming)


The Protofire team is glad to present this proposal to build the next most important application: a **Bidder Interface**.

### What project are you building
Bidder UI for the DutchX open protocol

### Why did you decide to build it
We've been following the DutchX open protocol closely over its development and saw how the http://slow.trade was created and launched. This dApp targets sellers mainly. Therefore we identified the need for the counterparty dApp, for the bidder.

### How long will it take
Between 8 to 10 weeks. The UX/UI design and development has already started. We target to deliver an MVP by mid February.


### How much funding are you requesting
USD 40000 worth of DAI

### How did you hear about the GECO
Directly from the Gnosis team when we reached to them with the proposal.
